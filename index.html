        <p>My favorite chracter, Kelly Quinn is one of the three main characters in Just add Magic and the main protagonist in Season 1 and Season 2, the false protagonist of Season 3 and the tritagonist of Mystery City. She has two best friends: Hannah Parker-Kent and Darbie O'Brien, whom are former protectors along with her.Kelly is always willing to help out others, especially her friends and her grandmother. She especially cares for her grandmother, and does everything she can to save her in Season 1.She is very strong-willed (like Darbie at one point, but it was just a spell) and doesn't let anything get to her head. She can be pretty naive at times and doesn't believe in things that she knows aren't true. She also is very sensitive and is very gullible, especially in Season 1 when she thinks that Hannah betrays her and instead gets tricked into working with Mama P. She can be a little selfish. Kelly can be bossy but has great ideas. She is passionate about what she cares about. She cooks many recipes and is obsessed to her cookbook. One of Kelly's main traits is to always do things on her own and not wait for other people. She soon realizes this trait in Just Add Gumdrops. However, when she is under the influence of the magic spice garden's poison, she wants to be the cookbook's protector forever, thinking that without it, she won't be friends with Hannah and Darbie anymore. She conspires with Mama P, disguised as Erin Chua, the new owner of Mama P's (now called Springtown Coffee), but it was just a spell, and Hannah and Darbie manage to break it.</p>
